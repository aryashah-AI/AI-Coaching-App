OVERALL PERFORMANCE SCORE: 51.9/100

HOP PHASE ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
Performance Score: 71.8/100

Angle Comparison:
  Left Knee Avg: 127.3° (Reference: 125.0°, Difference: +2.2°)
  Right Knee Avg: 116.5° (Reference: 107.4°, Difference: +9.0°)
  Left Hip Avg: 127.3° (Reference: 125.0°, Difference: +2.2°)

STEP PHASE ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
Performance Score: 31.3/100

Angle Comparison:
  Left Knee Avg: 124.9° (Reference: 107.4°, Difference: +17.4°)
  Right Knee Avg: 118.7° (Reference: 108.6°, Difference: +10.1°)
  Left Hip Avg: 124.9° (Reference: 107.4°, Difference: +17.4°)
  Right Hip Avg: 118.7° (Reference: 108.6°, Difference: +10.1°)

Recommendations:
  1. In step phase: left knee is too extended (+17.4°). Focus on maintaining better knee flexion for optimal power transfer.
  2. In step phase: right knee is too extended (+10.1°). Focus on maintaining better knee flexion for optimal power transfer.
  3. In step phase: left hip shows excessive extension (+17.4°). Focus on hip flexor strength and mobility.
  4. In step phase: right hip shows excessive extension (+10.1°). Focus on hip flexor strength and mobility.

JUMP PHASE ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
Performance Score: 52.6/100

Angle Comparison:
  Left Knee Avg: 101.0° (Reference: 117.0°, Difference: -16.0°)
  Right Knee Avg: 100.2° (Reference: 103.2°, Difference: -3.0°)
  Left Hip Avg: 101.0° (Reference: 117.0°, Difference: -16.0°)
  Right Hip Avg: 100.2° (Reference: 103.2°, Difference: -3.0°)

Recommendations:
  1. In jump phase: left knee is over-flexed (-16.0°). Work on improving leg extension for better distance.
  2. In jump phase: left hip is under-extended (-16.0°). Work on hip extension power for better takeoff.

SPECIFIC TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. In step phase: right hip shows excessive extension (+10.1°). Focus on hip flexor strength and mobility.
2. In step phase: left knee is too extended (+17.4°). Focus on maintaining better knee flexion for optimal power transfer.
3. In step phase: right knee is too extended (+10.1°). Focus on maintaining better knee flexion for optimal power transfer.
4. In jump phase: left hip is under-extended (-16.0°). Work on hip extension power for better takeoff.
5. In step phase: left hip shows excessive extension (+17.4°). Focus on hip flexor strength and mobility.
6. In jump phase: left knee is over-flexed (-16.0°). Work on improving leg extension for better distance.
