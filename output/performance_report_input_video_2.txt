OVERALL PERFORMANCE SCORE: 45.9/100

HOP PHASE ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
Performance Score: 59.2/100

Angle Comparison:
  Left Knee Avg: 136.4° (Reference: 125.0°, Difference: +11.3°)
  Right Knee Avg: 112.4° (Reference: 107.4°, Difference: +5.0°)
  Left Hip Avg: 136.4° (Reference: 125.0°, Difference: +11.3°)
  Right Hip Avg: 112.4° (Reference: 107.4°, Difference: +5.0°)

Recommendations:
  1. In hop phase: left knee is too extended (+11.3°). Focus on maintaining better knee flexion for optimal power transfer.
  2. In hop phase: left hip shows excessive extension (+11.3°). Focus on hip flexor strength and mobility.

STEP PHASE ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
Performance Score: 78.5/100

Angle Comparison:
  Left Knee Avg: 99.7° (Reference: 107.4°, Difference: -7.8°)
  Right Knee Avg: 107.8° (Reference: 108.6°, Difference: -0.8°)
  Left Hip Avg: 99.7° (Reference: 107.4°, Difference: -7.8°)
  Right Hip Avg: 107.8° (Reference: 108.6°, Difference: -0.8°)

Recommendations:
  • Excellent technique! Keep up the good work.

JUMP PHASE ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------
Performance Score: 0.0/100

Angle Comparison:
  Left Knee Avg: 90.3° (Reference: 117.0°, Difference: -26.7°)
  Right Knee Avg: 79.7° (Reference: 103.2°, Difference: -23.5°)
  Left Hip Avg: 90.3° (Reference: 117.0°, Difference: -26.7°)
  Right Hip Avg: 79.7° (Reference: 103.2°, Difference: -23.5°)

Recommendations:
  1. In jump phase: left knee is over-flexed (-26.7°). Work on improving leg extension for better distance.
  2. In jump phase: right knee is over-flexed (-23.5°). Work on improving leg extension for better distance.
  3. In jump phase: left hip is under-extended (-26.7°). Work on hip extension power for better takeoff.
  4. In jump phase: right hip is under-extended (-23.5°). Work on hip extension power for better takeoff.

SPECIFIC TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. In hop phase: left hip shows excessive extension (+11.3°). Focus on hip flexor strength and mobility.
2. In jump phase: right knee is over-flexed (-23.5°). Work on improving leg extension for better distance.
3. In jump phase: left hip is under-extended (-26.7°). Work on hip extension power for better takeoff.
4. In jump phase: left knee is over-flexed (-26.7°). Work on improving leg extension for better distance.
5. In jump phase: right hip is under-extended (-23.5°). Work on hip extension power for better takeoff.
6. In hop phase: left knee is too extended (+11.3°). Focus on maintaining better knee flexion for optimal power transfer.
